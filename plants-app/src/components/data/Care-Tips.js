const Sun=[
    'How much light do indoor plants need?',
    'Light is just as important as water. All plants need light to carry out their necessary biological processes. Succulents and cacti need continuous, daily sunlight. Plants with foliage need roughly 8 hours of light per day. The amount of light depends on the plants you are growing, so we suggest doing research on the specific plants you are growing. Indoor plants that need little light could be good fits for locations where light is more dim.'

const Watering=[
    'It’s Better to Underwater Your Plants Than Overwater Them',
    'For potted plants at home, you may be unsure of how often to water them. For most plants, the golden rule is to see if the first inch or so of soil is dry. If dry, this is an indication that the plant needs water. If there are leaves that have shriveled or are dry/discolored, the plant might need a little extra water than a regular routine.',
    'Feel the Soil to Know How Often to Water Your Plants',
    'A plant can recover faster from being deprived of water than one given excess water. To rescue an overwatered plant, you may need to repot the plant and remove any unhealthy roots and overwatered soil before moving the plant into a new pot.',
    'Water Deeply, Rather Than Lightly and Frequently',
    'When you water lightly and frequently, only the top roots are able to drink the water, and your plant may not receive the fuel it needs to survive. Watering deeply, which entails watering your plants heavily with water, allows for all the roots to grab a drink. To avoid overwatering, slowly water your plant and watch for when the water is not draining through the soil anymore. Once you notice this, stop there.',

const Humidity=[
    'Most Plants Flourish in High Humidity',
    'With most homes having dry air, especially in the winter, you may want to adjust the air. This could be as simple as purchasing a humidifier for the rooms of your home that contain your adored plants.',

const Temperature=[
'The Right Temperature',
 'Almost all houseplants need a minimum temperature of 55ºF to survive. Keep plants away from areas of cold drafts in the winter. The warmer it gets for houseplants, the happier they are!'

const Fertilizing=[
    'Skip Fertilization for Houseplants if You’re Unsure',
    'Houseplants don’t require fertilization unless they are struggling to grow. If you’re unsure of how much or what type of fertilization to use when planting, it’s better to skip that step altogether. Too much fertilization may actually end up killing your plant rather than helping it. Most houseplants thrive in balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer. House plants need the nutrients from potting soils and fertilizers in order to survive. If you don’t repot the plant, or add new nutrients to the soil, the plant will eventually die. The first number stands for nitrogen, second number for phosphorus, and the third for potassium.',

const Repotting=[
    'Don’t Repot Your Plants by Pulling Them!',
    'Pulling a plant out will not only ruin the stems, leaves, and blossoms but will also tear roots. Damaged roots need to heal before they can fully take in nutrients, so pulling your plant out of its pot is never a good plan.',

const Prunning=[
    'Prune Your Plants',
    'Getting rid of old-growth on your plants will help your plants grow again. This is kind of like how trimming the dead ends of your hair will help your hair grow again. After winter is when you’ll see some of the tips or leaves of your plant dying, so a simple plant haircut will do!'

const TravelCare=[
    'Ways to Keep Plants Alive While Away on Vacation',
    'If you only plan on being gone for a short period of time, say less than two weeks, there are a few things you should do before leaving. The day before you leave for your trip, gather up all of your houseplants, removing any dead leaves or flowers, and give them a good, thorough soaking, draining all excess water from their saucers. Group the plants in the bathtub on pebble trays or a layer of plastic covered with wet newspaper. The plants can then be covered with plastic to keep humidity high. Use some form of staking to keep the plastic off the houseplants’ foliage.',
